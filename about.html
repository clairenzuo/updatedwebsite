         <p>I’m currently an undergrad student at the University of Michigan. I live in New York and was born and raised in Toronto, Canada. 
          I’ve always loved traditional art, but have expanded my passion towards technology based design. Studying interactions between users and their screens has become a great interest to me, and learning to apply the design theories and illustration techniques I’ve previously learned to user interaction has been really eye-opening. It allows me to be hands on in all stages of app designing process from creating screens to illustrating them to prototyping them!<br>
          Expanding my interests is one of the most important things to me, and I’m forever searching to learn new forms to express myself through. I often explore my creative pursuits through experimenting with a vast variety of different aspects of art and design. </p>
